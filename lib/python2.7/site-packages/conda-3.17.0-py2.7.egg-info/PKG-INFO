        Conda is a cross-platform, Python-agnostic binary package manager. It is the
        package manager used by `Anaconda
        <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index.html>`_ installations, but it may be
        used for other systems as well.  Conda makes environments first-class
        citizens, making it easy to create independent environments even for C
        libraries. Conda is written entirely in Python, and is BSD licensed open
        source.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Conda is a part of the `Anaconda distribution <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_.  You can also download a
        minimal installation that only includes conda and its dependencies, called
        `Miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_.
        
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        If you install Anaconda, you will already have hundreds of packages
        installed.  You can see what packages are installed by running
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ conda list
        
        to see all the packages that are available, use
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ conda search
        
        and to install a package, use
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ conda install <package-name>
        
        
        The real power of conda comes from its ability to manage environments. In
        conda, an environment can be thought of as a completely separate installation.
        Conda installs packages into environments efficiently using `hard links
        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_links>`_ by default when it is possible, so
        environments are space efficient, and take seconds to create.
        
        The default environment, which ``conda`` itself is installed into is called
        ``root``.  To create another environment, use the ``conda create``
        command. For instance, to create an environment with the IPython notebook and
        NumPy 1.6, which is older than the version that comes with Anaconda by
        default, you would run
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ conda create -n numpy16 ipython-notebook numpy=1.6
        
        This creates an environment called ``numpy16`` with the latest version of
        the IPython notebook, NumPy 1.6, and their dependencies.
        
        We can now activate this environment, use
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           # On Linux and Mac OS X
           $ source activate numpy16
           
           # On Windows
           > activate numpy16
        
        This puts the bin directory of the ``numpy16`` environment in the front of the
        ``PATH``, and sets it as the default environment for all subsequent conda commands.
        
        To go back to the root environment, use
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           # On Linux and Mac OS X
           $ source deactivate
           
           # On Windows
           > deactivate
        
        
        Building Your Own Packages
        --------------------------
        
        You can easily build your own packages for conda, and upload them
        to `anaconda.org <https://anaconda.org>`_, a free service for hosting
        packages for conda, as well as other package managers.
        To build a package, create a recipe.
        See http://github.com/conda/conda-recipes for many example recipes, and
        http://docs.continuum.io/conda/build.html for documentation on how to build
        recipes.
        
        To upload to anaconda.org, create an account.  Then, install the
        anaconda-client and login
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ conda install anaconda-client
           $ anaconda login
        
        Then, after you build your recipe
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ conda build <recipe-dir>
        
        you will be prompted to upload to anaconda.org.
        
        To add your anaconda.org channel, or the channel of others to conda so
        that ``conda install`` will find and install their packages, run
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           $ conda config --add channels https://conda.anaconda.org/username
        
        (replacing ``username`` with the user name of the person whose channel you want
        to add).
        
        Getting Help
        ------------
        
        The documentation for conda is at http://conda.pydata.org/docs/. You can
        subscribe to the `conda mailing list
        <https://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/forum/#!forum/conda>`_.  The source
        code and issue tracker for conda are on `GitHub <https://github.com/conda/conda>`_.
        
        Contributing
        ------------
        
        Contributions to conda are welcome. Just fork the GitHub repository and send a
        pull request.
        
        To develop on conda, the easiest way is to use ``python setup.py develop`` in your
        root conda environment. This will install a link to the local conda source
        code, so that any change you make to conda will be instantly available. To undo
        this, run ``python setup.py develop -u``.  If you are worried about breaking
        your conda installation, you can install a separate instance of `Miniconda
        <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_ and work off it. This is also the
        only way to test conda in both Python 2 and Python 3, as conda can only be
        installed into a root environment.
        
        Run the conda tests by ``conda install pytest`` and then running ``py.test``
        in the conda directory. The tests are also run by Travis CI when you make a
        pull request.
